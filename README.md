With the use of bootstrap features and custom styling, I created a website tailored towards an event called ROBOFEST, where programmers for automation, robotics and computer science and general can meet. 

Website contains simple animations that fit the theme while also making heavy use of bootstrap elements. Some media query is used for small fixes for smaller devices. Overlaying items with animations under certain website elements adds to the appeal and theme of the website. 

Overall, this was an interesting project to make and it was nice to experiment more with z indexes and animations.
